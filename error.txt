git commit -am "refined LLM backend to identify useful violations and simplified the UI." -m "this appears to work but the outputs from ollama are non-sensical. I provided it a main function and it asked for the class name to be in PascalCase. The files I tested on had no memory allocation (but they use vectors) and ollama identified memory leaks with the message 'The function sorter() allocates memory with new[] but does not delete it.' which doesn't make sense because new is never called. It identified the existance of a class and a switch statement when only the main function was being defined. It also identified the 'value' variable as being shadowed. is it trying to grade the examples at the bottom of the semantic style guide? ... can you remove the statements from semantic_style_guide.txt that allow for magic number checking. Then can we remove the rag management screen and instead use the style guide drop down box to upload style guides when the user selects an option inside the drop down to upload style guide."

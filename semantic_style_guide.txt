C++ Semantic Style Guide (for LLM Analysis)
================================================================================

This guide contains SEMANTIC rules for code analysis. Formatting rules
(tabs/spaces, line length, brace placement) are handled by automated tools
and should NOT be checked by the LLM analyzer.

================================================================================

CRITICAL SEVERITY - Must Fix (Correctness & Safety Issues)
================================================================================

Memory Management:
- All dynamically allocated memory (new/malloc) must have a corresponding delete/free
- No memory leaks - check for unmatched allocation/deallocation pairs
- Array allocations (new[]) must use array delete (delete[])
- No dangling pointers - pointers should be set to nullptr after deletion
- No double deletion of the same memory

Control Flow Issues:
- All switch statements must have a default case
- No use of goto statements (violates structured programming)
- Return statements must be present in all non-void functions for all code paths

Variable Safety:
- Function parameters must not shadow member variables
- Local variables must not shadow outer scope variables
- No use of uninitialized variables


WARNING SEVERITY - Should Fix (Best Practices & Maintainability)
================================================================================

Naming Conventions:
- Function names should use camelCase (e.g., calculateSum, not calculate_sum)
- Class names should use PascalCase (e.g., BankAccount, not bank_account)
- Member variables should have descriptive names (avoid single letters except i, j, k for loops)

Code Structure:
- Avoid deeply nested code (more than 3 levels of nesting)
- Functions should be reasonably short (under 50 lines)
- Complex algorithms should have explanatory comments
- Break long functions into smaller, focused helper functions

Modern C++ Practices:
- Use nullptr instead of NULL or 0 for null pointers
- Prefer smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) over raw pointers for ownership
- Use auto for complex iterator types, but not for basic types where clarity is lost

Header File Best Practices:
- Include guards must be present in all header files (#ifndef, #define, #endif)
- Avoid "using namespace std" in header files (causes namespace pollution)
- Forward declare classes when possible instead of including headers

Control Structures:
- All control structures (if, for, while, switch) must use braces even for single statements
- Prefer pre-increment (++i) over post-increment (i++) in loops for consistency


MINOR SEVERITY - Good Practice (Code Quality & Readability)
================================================================================

Documentation:
- Files should have header comments describing purpose and author
- Functions should have brief comments explaining their purpose
- Complex algorithms should include explanatory comments
- Public APIs should be documented

Code Organization:
- Group related member functions together in class definitions
- Separate public/private/protected sections clearly in classes
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid abbreviations unless well-known)
- Variable declarations should be one per line for clarity

Readability:
- Use whitespace around operators for readability (e.g., a + b not a+b)
- Add blank lines between logical sections of code
- Align related declarations vertically when it improves readability


================================================================================
Focus Areas for LLM Analysis
================================================================================

1. MEMORY MANAGEMENT: The most critical area - find all allocation/deallocation mismatches
2. RESOURCE LEAKS: File handles, network sockets, database connections
3. LOGIC ERRORS: Uninitialized variables, off-by-one errors, incorrect comparisons
4. NAMING: Consistency with camelCase/PascalCase conventions
5. CODE STRUCTURE: Overly complex functions, deep nesting
6. MODERN C++: Use of nullptr, smart pointers

DO NOT analyze formatting (the automated checker handles that).
